6. **Preserve Writer's Voice**
   
   Important principles:
   
   - **Learn their style**: Read existing writing samples
   - **Suggest, don't replace**: Offer options, not directives
   - **Match tone**: Formal, casual, technical, friendly
   - **Respect choices**: If they prefer their version, support it
   - **Enhance, don't override**: Make their writing better, not different
   
   Ask periodically:
   - "Does this sound like you?"
   - "Is this the right tone?"
   - "Should I be more/less [formal/casual/technical]?"

7. **Citation Management**
   
   Handle references based on user preference:
   
   **Inline Citations**:
   ```markdown

   **Numbered References**:
   ```markdown

   ```
   
   **Footnote Style**:
   ```markdown
   Studies show 40% productivity improvement^1
   
   ^1: McKinsey Global Institute. (2024)...
   ```
   
   Maintain a running citations list:
   ```markdown
