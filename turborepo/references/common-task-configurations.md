## Common Task Configurations

### Standard Build Pipeline

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://v2-8-12-canary-2.turborepo.dev/schema.json",
  "tasks": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**", ".next/**", "!.next/cache/**"]
    },
    "dev": {
      "cache": false,
      "persistent": true
    }
  }
}
```

Add a `transit` task if you have tasks that need parallel execution with cache invalidation (see below).

### Dev Task with `^dev` Pattern (for `turbo watch`)

A `dev` task with `dependsOn: ["^dev"]` and `persistent: false` in root turbo.json may look unusual but is **correct for `turbo watch` workflows**:

```json
// Root turbo.json
{
  "tasks": {
    "dev": {
      "dependsOn": ["^dev"],
      "cache": false,
      "persistent": false  // Packages have one-shot dev scripts
    }
  }
}

// Package turbo.json (apps/web/turbo.json)
{
  "extends": ["//"],
  "tasks": {
    "dev": {
      "persistent": true  // Apps run long-running dev servers
    }
  }
}
```

**Why this works:**

- **Packages** (e.g., `@acme/db`, `@acme/validators`) have `"dev": "tsc"` — one-shot type generation that completes quickly
- **Apps** override with `persistent: true` for actual dev servers (Next.js, etc.)
- **`turbo watch`** re-runs the one-shot package `dev` scripts when source files change, keeping types in sync

**Intended usage:** Run `turbo watch dev` (not `turbo run dev`). Watch mode re-executes one-shot tasks on file changes while keeping persistent tasks running.

**Alternative pattern:** Use a separate task name like `prepare` or `generate` for one-shot dependency builds to make the intent clearer:

```json
{
  "tasks": {
    "prepare": {
      "dependsOn": ["^prepare"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**"]
    },
    "dev": {
      "dependsOn": ["prepare"],
      "cache": false,
      "persistent": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Transit Nodes for Parallel Tasks with Cache Invalidation

Some tasks can run in parallel (don't need built output from dependencies) but must invalidate cache when dependency source code changes.

**The problem with `dependsOn: ["^taskname"]`:**

- Forces sequential execution (slow)

**The problem with `dependsOn: []` (no dependencies):**

- Allows parallel execution (fast)
- But cache is INCORRECT - changing dependency source won't invalidate cache

**Transit Nodes solve both:**

```json
{
  "tasks": {
    "transit": { "dependsOn": ["^transit"] },
    "my-task": { "dependsOn": ["transit"] }
  }
}
```

The `transit` task creates dependency relationships without matching any actual script, so tasks run in parallel with correct cache invalidation.

**How to identify tasks that need this pattern:** Look for tasks that read source files from dependencies but don't need their build outputs.

### With Environment Variables

```json
{
  "globalEnv": ["NODE_ENV"],
  "globalDependencies": [".env"],
  "tasks": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**"],
      "env": ["API_URL", "DATABASE_URL"]
    }
  }
}
```
